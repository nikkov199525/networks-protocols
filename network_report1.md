# Практическая работа: Изучение базовых сетевых утилит терминала/командной строки

## Цель:
Целью данного задания является ознакомление и практическая работа с основными сетевыми утилитами терминала/командной строки.

# Задание 1:
1. Примените утилиты ping, netstat, traceroute или tracert, nslookup для сбора данных о сетевых подключениях.
2. Запишите результаты каждой команды в файл формата markdown.
3. Создайте отчет, в котором объясните функционал каждой утилиты и вставите результат выполнения команд.


## ping
Ping - утилита, позволяющая проверить доступность и качество сетевого соединения вашего компьютера и другого узла сети (компьютера, сервера, сайта).
Ping работает по протоколу ICMP: отправляет запросы (echo request) к узлу назначения и фиксирует их возвращение (echo reply). Процесс отправки пакетов называется пингованием — по его результатам можно судить о качестве сетевого соединения.
Синтаксис:
ping доменное имя сайта или IP-адрес
У команды ping есть дополнительные параметры, которые расширяют возможности утилиты. Например, с их помощью можно указать количество отправляемых пакетов, интервалы между ними, размер пакетов, используемый сетевой протокол, время ожидания и многое другое.

# traceroute (или tracert)
Traceroute или Tracert – это утилита, служащая для диагностики сети. Она отслеживает пути, по которым пакеты данных проходят от источника к хосту назначения, что позволяет администраторам оперативно решить проблемы с подключением.
В Windows эта команда называется Tracert, а в Linux и MacOS – Traceroute.
Traceroute и Tracert в основном работают одинаково – они предоставляют информацию о пути пакета данных из одной точки сети на конкретный IP-сервер. Когда данные передаются между двумя точками, они должны проходить через несколько устройств (например, маршрутизаторы).
Traceroute сопоставляет каждый переход, предоставляет подробную информацию и время приёма-передачи (RTT), а также, по возможности, сообщает имя устройства и IP-адрес.
В то время как команда Ping может сообщить, есть ли проблема, Traceroute поможет вам точно определить, где именно она образовалась.
Как работает Traceroute и Tracert?
1. По протоколу UDP (User Datagram Protocol – «протокол пользовательских датаграмм») Traceroute отправляет последовательность IP-пакетов. Всего таких пакетов по умолчанию может быть 3.
2. Первый пакет имеет время жизни (также известное как TTL (Time To Live) или лимит переходов), равное 1, второй пакет имеет TTL=2 и так далее.
3. Каждый раз, когда пакет передается новому маршрутизатору, TTL уменьшается на 1. Это сделано для предотвращения проблем с зацикливанием между серверами. Если бы не было TTL, пакет мог бы бесконечно долго перебрасываться между серверами.
Когда время жизни достигает 0, пакет отбрасывается, а маршрутизатор возвращает сообщение об ошибке. Отправляя пакеты таким образом, Traceroute гарантирует, что каждый маршрутизатор на пути отклонит пакет и отправит ответ.

# Задание 3: Проектирование сети предприятия
Спроектируйте сеть для предприятия "Рога и Копыта", расположенного в одноэтажном офисе размером 300х300 метров. Укажите, какие сетевые устройства и топологии будут использоваться в локальной сети предприятия. Обоснуйте свой выбор оборудования и топологии.
Можно использовать звезду и подключить это все к центральному коммутатору. Можно было бы использовать кольцо или шину, но тогда отказоустойчивость сети будет ниже, да и выход из строя одного устройства может повлечь отказ работы всей сети. В плане оборудования можно использовать коммутатор на 48 портов, 1 роутер для того, чтобы можно было выходить в сеть internet и точки доступа, чтобы можно было подключаться к сети по wifi.
